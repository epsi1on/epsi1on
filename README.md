# I'm Leaving GitHub! 👋
Microsoft is holder company of GitHub, and Microsoft was/is a very effective compliance of Isr-ael military (by providing AI infrasctructure for them.)

Isr-ael is doing the genocide in Gaza, indeed with (ongoing) help of Microsoft and other tech companies.

So I rather not use GitHub for my opensource activity. I suggest you to stay away from companies which ultimately the money is only thing which they care about. 

GitHub was great, just before being Microsoft's property in 2018. Recently GitHub is becoming a Hub just for Git, not for opensource contributors.
